AcciVision is a Flask-based accident monitoring system that runs a custom YOLO model on uploaded traffic videos or browser camera frames, saves accident snapshots, and routes incidents through an admin review and responder workflow.

## ✨ What This Project Does

| Area | Current Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| 🎥 Detection input | Admin users can upload supported video files or open the device camera from the browser. |
| 🧠 AI model | `best.pt` is loaded once at startup with Ultralytics YOLO and labels from `coco.txt`. |
| 🖼️ Frame processing | Frames are resized, analyzed by YOLO, annotated with bounding boxes, and returned to the browser. |
| 🚨 Alert signal | Accident detections set a server-side flag; the browser polls it and plays `warning.mp3`. |
| 📸 Evidence | Detected accident frames are saved as JPEG snapshots in `static/accidents/`. |
| 🗂️ Persistence | SQLite stores users, saved accident records, lifecycle status, responder status, and timestamps. |
| 👤 Admin workflow | Admins run detection, review incidents, approve alerts, or mark false alarms. |
| 🚑 Responder workflow | Responders see dispatched alerts, inspect evidence, update status, and resolve cases. |

## 🧠 Accident Detection Pipeline

The core detection path lives in `process_frame(frame)` inside `app.py`.

| Step | Code Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Normalize frame | Every processed frame is resized to `768 x 432`. |
| 2. Run YOLO | `model.predict(frame, imgsz=512, conf=0.45, verbose=False)` runs inference. |
| 3. Read detections | The app reads each YOLO box, confidence score, and class ID. |
| 4. Resolve label | Class IDs are mapped through `coco.txt`, currently `accident` and `cars`. |
| 5. Draw overlays | Accident boxes above `0.60` are red; all other detections are green. |
| 6. Trigger warning | If an accident is detected, the frame gets a warning banner and `accident_flag = True`. |
| 7. Save snapshot | Streaming routes call `try_save_snapshot(processed)` when detection is true. |
| 8. Throttle evidence | Snapshots are saved at most once every `30` seconds. |
| 9. Persist alert | A background thread writes the JPEG and inserts an `accidents` row. |

        UI->>Flask: Poll /accident_status
        Flask-->>UI: accident=true once
        UI->>UI: Play warning.mp3
    end
```

### Detection Confidence Logic

| Threshold | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0.45` | YOLO prediction confidence threshold used by `model.predict(...)`. |
| `> 0.60` | A detection is treated as an accident only when its label is `accident` and confidence is above 60%. |
| 30 seconds | Snapshot throttle interval between saved accident images. |

> Current code note: the database has `confidence`, `source_video`, and `detection_time_seconds` columns, but the active snapshot insert only stores `id`, `image`, `timestamp`, and `notified`. Therefore confidence and detection-time dashboard values may remain default/empty unless existing database rows already contain those fields.

## 🎥 Live Camera & Video Upload Workflows

### Uploaded Video

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Admin opens Test Model page] --> B[Selects or drags video file]
    B --> C[Send video to upload endpoint]
    C --> D[Validate file type and size limit]
    D --> E[Save video inside uploads folder]
    E --> F[Browser opens video feed endpoint]
    F --> G[OpenCV reads video frames]
    G --> H[Run accident detection function]
    H --> I[Return annotated video stream]
    I --> J[Browser displays processed video]
    J --> K[Delete uploaded file after stop or completion]
```

Supported upload extensions:

`mp4`, `avi`, `mov`, `mkv`, `wmv`, `webm`

---

### Browser Camera

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Admin clicks Open Camera] --> B[Browser requests camera permission]
    B --> C[Camera stream appears in browser]
    C --> D[Browser captures frame from video]
    D --> E[Convert frame to JPEG blob]
    E --> F[Send frame to process camera frame endpoint]
    F --> G[Decode frame using OpenCV]
    G --> H[Run accident detection function]
    H --> I[Return annotated base64 image]
    I --> J[Browser updates live preview]
```

There is also a server-side `/camera_feed` route that uses OpenCV camera index `0`, but the current `detect.html` browser workflow uses `/process_camera_frame`.

## 🚨 Alert Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> new: Snapshot inserted
    new --> sent_to_responder: Admin approves
    new --> false_alarm: Admin marks false alarm
    sent_to_responder --> responded: Responder acknowledges / en route / on scene
    responded --> closed: Responder resolves
    sent_to_responder --> closed: Responder resolves directly
    false_alarm --> [*]
    closed --> [*]
```

| State | Stored Value | Visible To | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New | `new` or legacy empty status with `notified = 0` | Admin | Detection saved and waiting for review. |
| Active | `sent_to_responder` | Admin + Responder | Admin approved and dispatched the alert. |
| Responded | `responded` | Admin + Responder | A responder has accepted/progressed the case. |
| Closed | `closed` | Admin + Responder | The responder resolved the case. |
| False Alarm | `false_alarm` | Hidden from live queues | Admin dismissed it before dispatch. |

### Responder Status Values

| Value | UI Label |
| --- | --- |
| `pending` | Pending |
| `acknowledged` | Acknowledged |
| `en_route` | En Route |
| `on_scene` | On Scene |
| `resolved` | Resolved |

---

## 🗄️ Database Usage

The application uses SQLite through `accivision.db`. On startup, `init_db()` creates missing tables and adds missing columns with non-destructive `ALTER TABLE` migrations.

### `users`

| Column | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Auto-incrementing user ID. |
| `email` | Unique login email. |
| `password` | Werkzeug hash; legacy SHA/plain values can be upgraded after successful login. |
| `role` | `admin` or `responder`. |
| `created_at` | Creation timestamp. |

### `accidents`

| Column | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `id` | Short UUID-based incident ID. |
| `image` | Snapshot filename in `static/accidents/`. |
| `timestamp` | Unix timestamp when the snapshot was captured. |
| `notified` | Whether the alert was sent to responders. |
| `responded` | Whether a responder has acted on it. |
| `closed` | Whether the incident is resolved. |
| `status` | Main lifecycle state. |
| `sent_at`, `reported_at` | Dispatch timestamps. |
| `responded_at` | First responder action time. |
| `closed_at` | Resolution time. |
| `response_status` | Responder progress value. |
| `assigned_responder` | Responder email or `Responder Team`. |
| `confidence` | Schema field for confidence; current insert path leaves it at default unless pre-existing rows include data. |
| `source_video` | Schema field for source video; current insert path does not populate it. |
| `detection_time_seconds` | Schema field for inference timing; current insert path does not populate it. |

## ⚙️ Installation & Run

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The local development server starts on:

```text
http://localhost:5001
```

Required runtime files in the project root:

| File | Required For |
| --- | --- |
| `best.pt` | YOLO accident detection model. |
| `coco.txt` | Class label lookup. |
| `accivision.db` | SQLite storage; created/migrated by the app if needed. |

---

## 🧪 Current Dependencies

```text
flask
opencv-python
pandas
ultralytics
numpy
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Access Control

AcciVision uses Flask sessions and role decorators:

| Decorator | Protects |
| --- | --- |
| `login_required` | Any authenticated route. |
| `admin_required` | Detection, admin dashboard, upload, alerts, dispatch, false alarm. |
| `responder_required` | Responder dashboard, responder alert details, response updates. |

Passwords are created with Werkzeug password hashing. The verifier also supports legacy SHA-256 or plain stored values and upgrades them to Werkzeug hashes after a successful login.

---

## ✅ Implementation Notes

- The YOLO model is loaded once globally: `YOLO(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "best.pt"))`.
- `coco.txt` currently defines two classes: `accident` and `cars`.
- Browser-camera detection sends JPEG frames to Flask about every `250ms`.
- Uploaded-video frames are streamed back as `multipart/x-mixed-replace`.
- Warning sound is polling-based, not WebSocket-based.
- Saved accident snapshots are throttled to reduce duplicate evidence during continuous detections.
- False alarms remain in the database but are hidden from live admin and responder queues.
- Locations shown in dashboards are generated display labels from the accident ID, not GPS coordinates.
